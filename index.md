## Flex Template Language Overview

Flex Template Language provides a simple way for front end developers and designers to build highly custom, serverless real estate websites, without being bogged down by complex backend integrations. 

### Data input ###
Real estate listing data is sourced from the [Sync REST API](http://www.entegral.net/sync/) and can be captured via your own systems or using [Base](http://www.entegral.net/base).

### Processing ###
The Flex processing engine automatically compiles and loads dynamic content into Flex semantic template pages using expressions,helpers,facets and components.  Pages can be developed using any front-end language while file uploads and website configuration can be done through the Flex Control Panel.  Flex is built on the Handlebars semantic template engine, and you can therefor use all the handlebar functionality to create beautiful custom websites. Through a range of helpers, components and plugins you are able to transform your data. You can integrate external content through a headless CMS architecture using Airtable.
